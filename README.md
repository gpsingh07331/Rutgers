<span style="display:block" class="note">

Circle provides a blockchain ecosystem with FIAT backed cryptocurrency to enable money transfer.<br>
[Jeremy Allaire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyallaire/) and [Sean Neville](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanneville/) founded Circle in 2013. $140 million from investors including Jim Breyer (Facebook), Goldman Sachs, IDG Capital (Baidu, Tencent), General Catalyst (AirBnB, Snapchat) and     Accel Partners backs the company, with its headquarters in Boston, and branches in New York, San Francisco, Dublin, London, and Hong Kong

- #### The foundation

**As per the Circle website**, 
> When Circle was founded five years ago, founders and many in the crypto community envisioned fiat money and financial contracts executing on top of distributed public network infrastructure, building on open standards that would allow  all to share value as instantly and easily as anyone can access content in web browsers and exchange messages in email and messaging apps. Just as HTTPS, SMTP and SIP enabled free borderless information sharing and communications, crypto assets and blockchain technology will enable us to exchange value and transact with one another in a similar way: instantly, globally, securely and at low cost.

>> "While announcing the launch, Circle founder Allaire said the company was working towards realizing its vision of no distinction between international and domestic money transfers." [PYMNTS.COM](https://www.pymnts.com/news/blockchain-distributed-ledger/2017/circle-launches-fee-free-blockchain-based-international-money-transfer/)

> A fundamental building block of this vision is the tokenization of fiat currency itself, through what are now referred to as fiat stablecoins. A safe, transparent and trustworthy layer for fiat to operate over open blockchains and within smart contracts is a necessary precondition to the broader and more revolutionary potential of a crypto-powered global economy. USDC aims to meet this need.
The word cryptocurrency itself creates attention and anxiety as the likes of bitcoin did, regulations, scams etc deterred the mainstream to use the digital currency. Circle, with stablecoin backed 1:1 by asset like USD and the founders readiness to work with regulators is envisioning it to become a mainstream digital currency. It has also worked on reducing the friction  and risk for any individual or business to use its Payments & treasury infrastructure.


Circle is privately owned funded by private equity. Circle has raised a total of $711M in funding over 10 rounds. Circle is funded by 39 investors. Pillar VC and Atlas Merchant Capital are the most recent investors,

To be viable the crytocurrency, *see inline for types of money*, must establish the three pillars of digital money viability. Currently the big banks, too big too fail, control, centralize and autocrize the transfer of payments, money between individuals and businesses. There are heavy fees and low transparency with existing solution using legacy banking system. 
Other crypto currencies lacked trust and marred by regulatory issues. 

> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/money.PNG" alt="Types of Stable Cryptocurrencies" /> 
source: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Cross-Border-Payments-with-Blockchain.pdf

Circle with payment infrastructure and stablecoin USDC (USD Coin) addresses above problems using blockchain technology  
* blockchain records are secure and reliable
* provides single view of truth to all
* records are immutable and is decentralized 
* enables smart contract which lowers fees as it removes third party involvment

USDC is a [FIAT stablecoin](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2103/2103.01340.pdf) backed by USD and which provides credibility and stability, unlike other cryptocurrencies which are highly volatile.
It is built on an open source framework with an open membership scheme that eligible Financial Institutions (FI) can participate in (CENTRE). USDC will be ERC-20 tokens minted, issued, and redeemed 
based on network rules defined by CENTRE. *see inline for types of stablecoin*
Circle supports open source platform with APIs and provides audit trail and is working under the jurisdiction of regulators and transmission laws.
Users can route USDC through the markets and into and out of the global currencies at the speed of the internet and digital asset exchanges

Let's assess the total M2 Money supply, cryptocurrency market and global digital payments market

* M2 Money supply refers to the total volume of money held by the public at a particular point in time in an economy. There are several ways to define "money", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits.[M2 Money Supply](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSgqn1-rT0AhV_SjABHW3UBdUQmhN6BAg9EAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMoney_supply&usg=AOvVaw1F3oMssV7kHX2RVk0GDdAn)

> [M2 US Supply](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2)

*  The global digital payments market size is expected to from USD 79.3 billion in 2020 to USD 154.1 billion by 2025, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.2%. The digital payments market is expected to grow, owing to the worldwide initiatives for the promotion of digital payments, proliferation of smartphones enabling mCommerce growth, increase in eCommerce sales, and growth in internet penetration. [Global Digital payments](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-payment-market-209834053.html)

* The global cryptocurrency market is projected to grow from $910.3 million in 2021 to $1,902.5 million in 2028 at a CAGR of 11.1% in forecast period, 2021-2028. [Global cryptocyurrency market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/cryptocurrency-market-100149)

* Blockchain: The blockchain, as well as other distributed ledger approaches (e.g., Ethereum) are another important digital platform development that 
could spur standardization and allow for improved multi-provider processes and applications. Compared to the existing financial infrastructures that are centralized and 
controlled by banks and other regulated financial intermediaries, the blockchain is a decentralized approach that automatically records all clientsâ€™ transactions in real- or near 
real-time. [Digital Banking 2025](https://www.xupery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Digital-Banking-2025.pdf)

Circle's open source project is called Centre and is named after the Cent Routing Exchange protocol it uses. Transfers within the app take place using Centre tokens (CENT), an Ethereum token.
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
It also uses AWS ECS, Graphql, REACT, cloudfare, NGINX and Modernizer.

> [CENTER Whitepaper](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/9304636/PDF/centre-whitepaper.pdf)

Additionaly from various sources on web,
* Circle uses 23 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. 
* Circle is actively using 96 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SPF.

Based on the Job openings in Circle's career section, we can get a hint of technolgy being used -
- Spark, Presto, Impala, YARN, Parquet, MLflow, Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Flink, Spark Streaming, etc.
- Airflow, Azkaban, Oozie, etc.
- loud Services (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc).

## **Landscape**

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">

Circle is a FinTech company which covers these domains
- Payments/Billing
- Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

#### Trends and Innovation in application of Blockchain in payment infrastructure and cryptocurrency
##### **Payments/Billing** <br>
A recent study done by PWC shows 6 macro trends in payment sector driven by technology, consumer experience, consumer trust and regulations.

> ![Payment Macro Trends](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/paytrend1.PNG) (https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/financial-services/publications/financial-services-in-2025/payments-in-2025.html#six-macro-trends)

In the same study the following solutions are trending,

- Machine-learning-based tools 
These are analytical services with machine learning and AI capabilities to identify authorised payment fraud. They encompass the necessary speed and processing capabilities that are required to analyse data in real-time. 

- Risk scoring tools
Risk scoring tools use statistical models to identify possibly fraudulent transactions. Risk scoring allocates a probability of fraud using evolving criteria.

- Mule account modelling tools 
Mule accounts (those set up by a real customer but with fraudulent papers or identity to enable criminal use) can be targeted using modelling tools that find behaviour patterns in anonymous crowdsourced intelligence from millions of daily consumer activities.

Another strudy done by [Mckinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/accelerating%20winds%20of%20change%20in%20global%20payments/2020-mckinsey-global-payments-report-vf.pdf) evaulates the share of payment sector against other financial sectors and payments companies continue to outperform other banking sectors in value creation. 

> ![Payment Macro Trends](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/paytrend2.PNG) 

As per a study done on [Digital banking in 2025](https://www.xupery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Digital-Banking-2025.pdf),
The blockchain, as well as other distributed ledger approaches (e.g., Ethereum) are another important digital platform development that could spur standardization 
and allow for improved multi-provider processes and applications. Compared to the existing financial infrastructures that are centralized and controlled by banks and other regulated financial intermediaries, the blockchain is a decentralized approach that automatically records all clientsâ€™ transactions in real- or near real-time. 

Another study done on patent analytics shows that the major patents have been filed in payment sector,
The sub-category of blockchain payment and transaction systems includes patents directed to the use of blockchain technology in money transfer. This category has the highest 
proportion of patent families of all the sub-categories of blockchain applications, with 61% (1,142 patent familes). Typical examples of patents in this sub-category are held by 
Digital Asset Holdings, nChain, Socure and Swirlds.

> <img src="https://101blockchains.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/History_of_Blockchain_Technology.png" alt="Blockchain timeline" width="800"/>


Future of blockchain in finance lies in
- Building Trust
- Digital identity 
- Digital wallets
- Tapping other financial markets like asset management
- Personalized customer service 
- Global standardization
- Smart contracts
- Interoperability among different systems

Stablecoins aim to preserve a stable value through at least two distinct mechanisms. Most commonly, stablecoin issuers purport to back stablecoins with fiat currency, assets or other cryptocurrencies; 
these are called asset-linked stablecoins. By contrast, algorithm-based stablecoins seek to use algorithms to increase or decrease the supply of stablecoins in response to changes in demand (FSB, 2020).
In parallel to the growth in market capitalisation (a stock measure), the use of stablecoins has increased, as seen in more transactions in stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain ([a flow measure](https://www.bis.org/publ/work905.pdf)).

> ![Stablecoin fluctuation and market capitilization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/Stablecoin.PNG)

A study done by PWC, [Stable Coin evolution and market trends](https://www.pwc.com.au/pdf/stable-coin-evolution-and-market-trends.pdf) observes that 
- Price stability
- Regulations
- Technology
- Support systems
- Compete against FIAT currency
are some of the factors currently impacting and in future will play more role in adoption of stablecoin. 
It is also observed that in future crypto and algorthim based cryptocurrency will see more innovation.



#### Competition
The top six FIAT backed stablecoins in the crypto market:

Currency | Market value | 24-hour trade volume | Trade to value ratio
:--------|:-------------|:---------------------|:---------------------|
Tether / USDT | $ 73.32 billion | $ 91.85 billion | 125.3 % |

#### Business Impact 
The key forces which is going to define Finance are
- Customer Segments, With the new generation being technology preferred, digitization cannot be avoided.
- Trust, low transparency in current banking systems is being offset by blockchain technology
- Interoperability, the payment systems need to enable open interoperability between new digital platforms and existing bank platforms. 
- Regulations, Increasing numbers of scams require the new systems to have audit trail and comply with transmission laws and AML that includes cross border payments.
- Democritization and Identity, Blockchain technology is based on decentrilization of banking.
- Speed, speed at which transactions are cleared and in safe manner is being challenged with new digitization of banking.
- Volatality, Earlier cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and unstable and is a roadblock for mainstream consumption.

Circle is principal developer of USD Coin (USDC) which is backed by USD 1:1 and thus provides stability to the digital currency, which has become the fastest growing dollar digital currency in the world. USDC has grown to over 35 billion in circulation and supported over $1.3 trillion in transactions in the past year. Circle is built on an open source framework CENTRE, which enables interoperability across different payment systems and wallets. Circle also works to be compliance with Regulatory laws by providing detailed transparency and has integrated checks for KYC, AML and Risk management.
As per [Centre](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/9304636/PDF/centre-whitepaper.pdf) white paper, use of blockchain provides "the benefit of a transparent distributed mechanism for managing trusted updates to shared data among parties who have varying degrees of trust between one another; and a transferable store of value that is not tied to the policy of an issuing sovereign, but rather value based on the processing power, work, stake, and markets that support it."


##### Market Capitilization - Market cap is used to size up corporations and understand their aggregate market value.

> ![MCap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/Stablecoin1.PNG)

##### Growth 
- The compound annual growth rate [CAGR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) is the rate of return (RoR) that would be required for an investment to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each period of the investmentâ€™s life span.
- [EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp)

## **Recommendations**

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
    
##### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
USDC is cenrally controlled contrary to the vision of the creator of blockchain for it to be decentralized. Crypto and Algorthim based cryptocurrencies are other options but are not stable enough. 
To expand to other markets I would recommend them to do research in non-fiat backed currencies. Also, they are currently only offering currency backed by a single currency unlike Libra which provides options to be backed by multiple currencies and a pool of different currencies. 

    >![Value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/crypto.PNG)
    
Regulations and Legal Certainties, Due to different privacy laws of how long the data can be maintained and the requirement of "to be forgotten" is something which needs to be assessed by implementors of blockchain which are supposed to have immutable records.  I would recommend that Circle provide transparency and create options to accomodate each countries data privacy law. Transparency also needs to be shown as they take on multiple roles, such as currency, platform, wallet etc.

USDC is a proof of work cryptocurrency, Essentially, [proof of work](https://medium.com/bitstamp-blog/what-is-proof-of-work-18e637c9ce0c) necessitates solving a complex mathematical puzzle to create a new block of data. Solving the puzzle requires a large amount of processing power, which translates into high energy costs. Mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies accordingly requires significant amounts of electricity and processing power. I would recommend them to check other platforms which use proof of stake which is more climate freindly.




Risk management, I will recommend them to invest in AI to mine data to build tools which can assess risk to company, user and the financial system in real time.

Customer Experience, Digital Identity is something which the company can work towards to have a standardized cross border digital identity.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The financial industry so far has been centralized, low transparency, high cost, slow, and marred with mis-trust. 
Building trust and transparency with a sense of purpose is something post baby boomers and regulators will be looking for, but this can only be done digitizing the finance platforms.

> ![Importance of Digital Leadership in Choice of Bank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/citi.PNG)

Source: (https://www.citi.com/commercialbank/insights/assets/docs/2018/The-Bank-of-the-Future/files/assets/common/downloads/The%20Bank%20of%20the%20Future.pdf)

Digital Identity will help providing gurantees that the transactions are legal, KYC norms are automatic and human less. Digital Identity will improve in implementing ownership, accountability, identification(KYC compliance) and match blockchain accounts in trustable method. This will also help in interoperability and do away of the need of multiple accounts across institutions and countries.

Investing in risk management tools will help be in compliance with regulations and will build trust with governments and consumers by being transparent about volatility, stability, and open about who is and is not allowed to use the system and currency.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Aritificial Intelligence such as genetic adaptable algorithm to identify risks, volatility, fraud and consumer trends.
Cognitive computing to get insigths into behavior of consumers and impact of outside factors like news ets.
Mobile platform as more and more consumers prefer realtime instant interaction.

>![Some Terminologies and Methodologies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsingh07331/Rutgers/main/images/tech.PNG)

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

So far sompanies have employed blockchain or AI as standalone technologies to solve a particular problem but the future lies in combining these two to solve each individual problem.
Combining these two can help improve in customer support with persionalized and frictionless [customer engagement](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/21/how-to-improve-the-financial-services-industry-with-artificial-intelligence-and-blockchain/?sh=7fa62cf370c6), increase speed of transaction with improved decisions, [improve security and trust](https://techwave.net/blockchain-and-ai-the-advantages-of-merging-technologies/),[Optimizing energy consumption](https://intellias.com/five-benefits-of-combining-ai-and-blockchain/) and[Improving Standardization, Privacy, Security, and Scalability of Data](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.522600/full)
